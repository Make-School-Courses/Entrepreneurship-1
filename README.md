# Entrepreneurship 1: Growth, Validation, and Product-Market Fit

All businesses start with an idea. The trouble though is that idea isn't usually what turns into a successful business.

Entrepreneurs are not the same as business people.The job of an entrepreneur is to find a new business model. The job of business people is to execute efficiently an existing business model.

In this class you will act as entrepreneurs. You will run experiments to **Validate** business ideas. **Validation** means removing the false assumptions and risks that an idea for a business relies on. If these RATs are successful and you can validate your product you can begin to scale. If they are not successful, then you must pivot.

All our efforts early in a business's life is to demonstrate **Product-Market Fit** - that is demonstrate that there are people who will pay for the product you are building.

**This is not an engineering course.** You will not need to code more than some HTML/CSS, and it is better if you don't code at all and rely on off-the-shelf products like Survey Monkey and Google Drive to run your experiments.
